## Workflow

#### Readme
This is where we will document our workflow. The readme file will be shared on the master branch and should be updated as team members merge to their respective master branches and push to Github's master.

#### Git Workflow

* Each team member will create their own personal copy of the master branch.
* When a team member wishes to build a component or edit existing code they will create and checkout a new branch
* Upon completion of code editing or component completion. Team members will follow these steps:
  *  Pull from master branch on Github repository to insure code is up-to-date. 
  *  Then merge checked out branch with edits into your personal copy of the master branch and resolve any conflicts, if present.
  *  Finally push master to Github to update the project with your changes.
